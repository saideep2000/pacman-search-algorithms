# Pacman Simulation

This is Programming Assignment 1 in the Foundation of Artificial Intelligence

This is used from Berkeley Pacman project.
https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa22/projects/proj1/

## Project

In the project, we have:

### `Features`

1. We will take todos with the text input and a button to get it registered.\
2. When ever the task is done we can click on the radio button as completed.
3. There is a button to remove the todo which are done.
4. There is a live count which tells us the todo left to be completed.
5. Our website will keep track of all the todos we registered, we will can reload to check wheather it's storing in the local_storage or not.

**Note: This is just a code uploaded for reference and as a `practice`, towards AI!**

## Process of project done

### Instructions:
This has 8 parts:

Q1 (3 pts): Finding a Fixed Food Dot using Depth First Search

Q2 (3 pts): Breadth First Search

Q3 (3 pts): Varying the Cost Function

Q4 (3 pts): A* search

Q5 (3 pts): Finding All the Corners

Q6 (3 pts): Corners Problem: Heuristic

Q7 (4 pts): Eating All The Dots

Q8 (3 pts): Suboptimal Search

#### Autograder is available for correctness of the code.

#### Files you'll edit:

search.py 	Where all of your search algorithms will reside.

searchAgents.py 	Where all of your search-based agents will reside.

#### Files you might want to look at:
pacman.py 	The main file that runs Pacman games. This file describes a Pacman GameState type, which you use in this project.

game.py 	The logic behind how the Pacman world works. This file describes several supporting types like AgentState, Agent, Direction, and Grid.

util.py 	Useful data structures for implementing search algorithms.

#### Ignore Other Files

#### Submission:
token generated by submission_autograder.py

### Things Used:

### Shortcuts that help (mac):
python version - python3
python3 pacman.py
#### Agents:
python3 pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
python3 pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
CTRL + C in terminal to exit the game.
##### For list of options:
python3 pacman.py -h


python3 pacman.py -l tinyMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=tinyMazeSearch


## Happy Coding...
